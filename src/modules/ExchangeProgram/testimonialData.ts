I\'ve said I want to speak Igbo for the longest but never felt I had the tools to really learn. Using the Conversation Exchange program\'s resources has helped me build the confidence to actively engage in conversation with others and truly make progress on my Igbo learning journey. And I\'ve seen the results -- I have hosted and participated in Instagram Live sessions and other virtual events almost entirely in Igbo!The live calls have been integral because they allow me to engage with a native speaker who is willing and able to practice with me and work through the stumbles and trip-ups that are part of language learning. Another major benefit Oji Abila offers is community. I have met so many wonderful people who are also on this journey and that is a valuable bonus that has provided another source of support and encouragement. Learning a language as an adult can seem intimidating. However, it is definitely not impossible and I would highly recommend Oji Abiala as a guide on your learning journey!',
