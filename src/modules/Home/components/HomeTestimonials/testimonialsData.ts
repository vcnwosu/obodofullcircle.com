My conversation partner is awesome, he does a great job in making my learning easy and is very encouraging. He lets me know that I\'m improving.

My conversation partner is friendly, patient and understanding and I feel at ease even when I make mistakes. I am slowly beginning to understand more of the language and I get excited when I listen to an Igbo song and it makes sense or when I watch Igbo movies and can get a general idea of whatâ€™s going on.
