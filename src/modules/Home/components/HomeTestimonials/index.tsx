My conversation partner is awesome, he does a great job in making my learning easy and is very encouraging. He lets me know that I\'m improving. This is especially motivating for me because I sometimes need that reassuring word that I\'m making progress.  For anyone who wants learn or improve their igbo, I 100% recommend trying out the Igbo Conversation Exchange program, you\'ll love it! ðŸ™‚',

My conversation partner is friendly, patient and understanding and I feel at ease even when I make mistakes. I am slowly beginning to understand more of the language and I get excited when I listen to an Igbo song and it makes sense or when I watch Igbo movies and can get a general idea of whatâ€™s going on. Iâ€™m really grateful for this program and Iâ€™d definitely recommend it to others.',
